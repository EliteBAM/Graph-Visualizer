# Graph-Visualizer

Built in Unity.

Visualization software for graph data structures. Build your own graphs through GUI user input, and run algorithms on them. Watch as the algorithm is animated step by step. Currently only BFS and Shortest Path are supported. More extensive features may come in the future if I feel like it, or if anyone ends up taking interest in this.

## Features

- Construct your own graph by placing nodes into the environment and dragging connections between them
- Perform algorithms on your unique graphs and watch each step get animated before your eyes.
- Currently supported algorithms: Breadth First Search, Shortest Path

## Upcoming Features
I do not have plans to fully build out this side project, but if I did, these are the next features that would be made:

- Visualization polish
- Algorithm customization menu (ex. choose which nodes the shortest path algorithm starts and ends at on the grapb. Currently it just goes from first placed to last placed.)
- General ease of use features (clear graph, delete node, remove edge, etc.)
- Graph auto-generator (generate an initial grid of nodes of a custom size)
- Graph uploader (accept a properly formatted text file and generate a graph from its data)
- Full Directed and Undirected Graph support
- Weighted Graph support
